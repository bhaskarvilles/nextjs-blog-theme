**Web 1.0 and 2.0 :**

Web 1.0, an extension of DARPA’S ARPANET, was the first iteration of a new idea-a return to centralization after the distributed client server idea failed. Just before the Web came into use in the Wall Street business centre, personal computers used by businesses had a “fat client” distributed setup, in which each user had all the application code and data on their individual machine. The “fat client” became expensive and impractical to synchronize all these machines and data. So corporate intranets started to emerge with HTML and Java settler leading the way to the Web 1.0 idea: if we can connect all the computers in the world through a global network-the Internet-then we can trade and exchange assets and for humanity’s sake make the collective knowledge universally accessible. For this mass of data to be usable, it needed to be indexed and brow-sable. This necessity was behind the innovation that led to the first generation of the World Wide Web. The Netscape browser was the tool used to search, find, and render the response data.

Web 2.0 furthered the use of this global resource. The pool of knowledge and content began growing at an extreme pace. Surface net data has grown fourfold since 2012. Programs could connect and use the Web to store information and communicate with each other. Centralised intermediates, such as Google, created large databases and messaging, offering scalable resources and routing traffic. While these new information-handling organizations have changed our way of life with convenience services, they also use their centralized position for profit and power.

These centralized intermediates (like Google) sell context-sensitive targeted advertising for huge profits and give back nothing more than a convenient messaging interface to the users the content producers. In their paper “Swap, Swear and Swindle: Incentive System for Swarm,” Viktor Trón, Aron Fischer, Dániel A. Nagy, Zsolt Felföldi, and Nick Johnson characterized this as:
``“We give you scalable hosting that would cope with any traffic your audience throws at it, but you give us substantial control over your content; we are going to track each member of your audience and learn-and own-as much of their personal data as we can, we are going to pick who can and who cannot see it, we are going to proactively censor it and we may even report on you, for the same reason.”``

So the bottom line is that new media organizations and content producers created immense value for their organizations, and we the users receive less than a quid pro quo in exchange. To further exacerbate the problem, as the Web has grown it has been hampered by scaling limits. Central nodes or servers required increased bandwidth to handle increasing data flow. To compound the problem, the security available using Web 2.0 technology never achieved a level required for the new communications and commerce services provided through the Web. We see data breaches where nefarious syndicates steal our financial access data using SQL and code injection and disable financial, retail, and government websites and their services with denial-of-service attacks which take down these centralized servers almost weekly. According to Juniper Research, “the rapid digitisation of consumers’ lives and enterprise records will increase the cost of data breaches to $2.1 trillion globally by 2019, increasing to almost four times the estimated cost of breaches in 2015. The stage is set for a paradigm shift with a host of new technologies emerging.

**WEB 3.0 :**

Following the trend set by earlier iterations, and to correct some of the issues, Web 3.0 proposes a change in the way content and programs interact. If central intermediaries like Google are removed from the picture, many of the issues we have today are removed with them. Block chain technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum use public key cryptography to secure the connection and communication between programs and data. This is an alternative to the centrally issued SSL certificates used today. There is no central intermediary routing traffic, so connections can dynamically find the most efficient pathway through the Internet and route around congestion or damage. Additionally, for the coming Web 3.0 there is a debate about what is the proper definition of its characteristics. Which depicts the evolution of the Web, its actors, and components.

For some, Web 3.0 is powered by the semantic web, where people can access linked information fast and easily. According to Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations, Web 3.0 would be a “read-write-execute” web. Let’s take a look at two things that will form the basis of Web 3.0: semantic markup and web services. Semantic markup refers to the communication gap between human web users and computerized applications. One of the largest organizational challenges of presenting information on the Web was that web applications couldn’t provide context to data and therefore didn’t really understand what was relevant and what was not. While this is still evolving, this notion of formatting data to be understood by software agents leads to the “execute” portion of our definition and provides a way to discuss web service. A web service is a software system designed to support computer-to-computer interaction over the Internet. Web services are vendor agnostic. They are based on industry standards and can be interactive with all devices that can make service calls in standard APIs like SOAP or REST or any other emerging standard. The use and number of web services is trending up as it is a critical part of Web 3.0.

By combining a semantic markup and web services, Web 3.0 provides the potential for applications that can speak to each other directly and for broader searches for information through simpler interfaces. But now, with the emergence of a decentralized web powered by Blockchain technology, and since it enables unmediated transactions, there is a new focus on Web 3.0 based on the trustful nature of the blockchain. It is the “read-write-own” web. Here, the user owns and participates in owning the protocol. It is both peer-to-peer and machine-to machine. And it is applicable to people, companies, and autonomous entities. For instance, the term Web 3.0 is used by Ethereum in a different context than that suggested by Berners-Lee. It is proposed as the separation of content from the presentation by removing the need to have servers at all. Stephan Tual, formerly Ethereum’s CCO, defines that what makes Ethereum different from Web 2.0 is that “there are no web-servers, and therefore no middleman to take commissions, steal your data or offer it to the NSA, and of course nothing to DDoS. The transformation to blockchain distributed application (dapp) will happen over a period of years. The technology is currently unable to handle high-speed transactions.”
